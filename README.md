Abstract
This assignment involves the design and implementation of a social network simulation using object-oriented programming principles in Python.
The system consists of various classes, including User, Observer, and Post, which interact to create a functional social media platform. 
The User class allows for user registration, login, and interaction through posts, likes, and comments.
A singleton pattern is employed in the SocialNetwork class to ensure only one instance of the social network exists. 
The PostFactory class demonstrates the factory pattern by generating different types of posts, such as text, image, and sale posts. 
Observers can follow and unfollow users, receive notifications about user activities, and manage their own interactions on the platform. 
The assignment focuses on applying key OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a cohesive and extendable system.
